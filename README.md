## Potential Future Updates/Debugging

- Adding delete routes to all of the 'Upcoming Games' on each show page, as well as to the games on the 'myGames' tab. Definitely struggled with getting the myGames page to work in the first place, so it definitely needs some more love.
- Making each player's name on the roster clickable so that you can be redirected to a new page that shows info on each individual player!
- Even more fun styling with Tailwind!
- Add some animation, and more images!
